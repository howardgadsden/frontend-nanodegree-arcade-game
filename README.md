===============================

The game is started by opening index.html in a browser.

The objective of the game is to move the player to the water without colliding with an enemy. Enemies are the bugs crossing the game board from left to right. The left, right, up, and down arrows on the keyboard are used to move the player on the board. If the player collides with an enemy, the player is moved back to the start position. The cumulative number of collisions is displayed below the game board. Once the player reaches the water, a message is displayed. The message includes the number of times the player has won the game and instructs the user to press "Enter" to start over. When "Enter" is pressed, the player is moved back to the start position.
